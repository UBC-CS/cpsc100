At the start of every course, I like to hear a little bit from my students and collect some information about them.
There is a good reason for this survey: I want to understand your current learning environments.
It's pretty rough out there and many of us may have challenges with available technology/equipment, or access to wireless internet (or power).
The more I understand your circumstances (anonymously), the more I hope to do to accommodate everyone in the class.

Again, this is optional but please fill it out!!
