At the highest level, this courses has three main goals.

Students who complete this course will be able to

1. explain foundational computing concepts,
2. explore applications built on these foundations,
3. describe the implications of the applications.

Said more formally, students who actively engage with the materials will be able to:

## Foundations

- use abstraction and decomposition to clarify and simplify the critical pieces of a problem;
- choose appropriate models and representations to aid in solving the problem;
- recognize potential shortcomings in a model or solution;
- explain at a high level how the computer works;

## Applications

- explain specific computing algorithms;
- use algorithms to demonstrate a proficiency in describing processes
- create data products by utilizing applications

## Implications

- provide and explain examples of how computers impact society;
- discuss the advantages and limitations of recent computing advances;
- assess the veracity of statements based on foundational concepts
