This is the tentative plan for {{ COURSE_CODE }} this term.
Things may change depending on many factors so this is subject to change.

* Not for marks, used to get familiar with syllabus, course goals (Intro), and CBTF
** Alg 3 and Alg 4 are noted below in lecture notes, however, the Algorithms topic is only scheduled for 1 week above (Week 2, noted as Alg 1-3). If there are no 4 Alg 3 and Alg 4 classes, then everything can shift up 1 by week.
*** T9 can be shifted by 1 week so it is not during reading break, however, students may need to adjust their study schedules accordingly (since the topic would have been covered 2 weeks prior). My recommendations would be to provide them with 2 weeks time for maximum flexibility.
